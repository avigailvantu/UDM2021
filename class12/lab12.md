## Lab 12: Creating Dashboard with Google Data Studio 

### Data: 

For this assignment we will use data on Covid-19 cases and vaccinations worldwide from Our World in Data (https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data). 
* First download the Covid-19 vaccinations data by country.

### Getting started with Google Data Studio: 

Same as other Google products Google Data Studio is a free product that can be accessed using a Gmail account (your NYU account should work just fine here). It enables creating interactive data dashboards using data of your choice in just a few minutes. Dasboards are a very common tool these days for communicating data to non technical audience. Tools such as Tableau and Data Studio create pretty visualizations that can explain large amounts of data. In particular, summarization, % and comparisons are often the core of those dashboards. The result is usually displayed in one or two pages including a veriaty of data infographivs, tables and maps. 

1. Login to the Data Studio: https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/. Once youâ€™re logged-in the default page will look somwhat similiar to your drive. Note that all your previous work (if any) will be available here. Click on "create" or "blank report" to start working on a dashboard. !([https://github.com/avigailvantu/UDM2021/blob/main/class12/Screen%20Shot%202021-11-23%20at%2012.07.42%20PM.png]

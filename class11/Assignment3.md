Class 11: Google Earth Engine: Nigthtime lights data 

### Assignment 3 (due Nov 24th,2021) 

### Work in groups of 2-3. 

1. Find Singapore’s administrative boundary and load it as an asset into GEE 
2. Filter through the VIIRS Nighttime Day/Night Band Composites Version 1  collection to fetch the following composites: 
January - April 2013 
January - April 2021
Hint: use a reducer to extract the mean value for these 3 months. 
3.Create a new image which reflects the following calculation: 
The % growth in NTL between 2013 and 2021. 
Hint: Use a mathematical expression. Divide each pixel in (b) with its respective pixels in (a)
4. Clip the data to the Singapore polygon
5. Export these 3 outputs as Geotiffs and load them into QGIS. 

## Delivery:

a. Compare the outputs for 2013 and 2021. What are some visible differences? 
Using the quick OSM plugin, download OSM data (whatever key you think makes most sense) for Singapore  
Filter through the data and display the data that makes most sense to you. 
If you feel it’s needed, browse online for more data that could help you understand the growth in nighttime lights between 2013 and 2021  
Using the data and raster files you acquired for Singapore imagine you were asked by a retail store chain to provide an analysis of which areas of Singapore are experiencing the most growth:
can you tell a compelling story as to what type of trends accrued in Singapore between 2013 and 2019? 
Which land uses are most common in those area that experienced the largest growth in nighttime lights between 2013 and 2019?
Which neighborhood/area of Singapore would you recommend the retail store should locate in? Explain why?
Create a short presentation (3-5 slides) with your findings from the assignment. Include maps, data sources and discuss any missing data and limitations you encountered along the way.  The assignment is due next week, Nov 24th.

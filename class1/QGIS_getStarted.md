## QGIS Lab 1: Get started with QGIS

Welcome to Github an d to the Urban Data Mapping Class! Today we will go through our first experience with a very popular mapping tool called QGIS.
On top of the lab given in class this document should be pretty helpful in covering the essientials of getting started with QGIS.


#### 1. ðŸ¦‘ Downloading QGIS 3 ðŸ¦€
To get started you will need to download QGIS. Note that QGIS is an open source tool, it's totally free and can be downloaded on any OS (i.e. both MacOS and Windows).

Here's a link to QGIS's download page:

Any version of QGIS 3 should work for our class but I'm using 3.8.3.

I recommend using the NYU Data Services file to downloading QGIS. It includes instructions for both Windows and MacOS users and should be pretty straightforward to use.

### 2. The QGIS interface

Open QGIS and create a new project. You should see QGIS' main interface.

#### 1. Menu bar:
Among many other functionalities, the menu bar in the top of the project will allow running analyses, load data, and saving projects.  

#### 2. Browser & layer panel:
This section on the left part of your QGIS project includes some online maps you can display and the layers that are loaded into your current project.  

#### 3. Map area
Most of your QGIS project will be the map area where the data will be displayed.

#### 4. Status bar:
The bottom part of your QGIS interface will show the coordinate system for the project as well as the scale.
